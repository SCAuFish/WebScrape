# WebScrape
Include python programs written for WebScraping

#1. get IP addresses of users that modify Wikipedia pages
This project is also in another repository IP-Address-Crawler. You may check that for further details.

#2. get Avatar for users under a certain Zhihu Question.
Zhihu is a Chinese version of Quora. This program aims to get all users that answer a specific question.
The problem now is that the program only gets the first two users' avatars. Still don't know how to solve
the problem. Probably due to the website's anti-crawler policy. If I am able to get dynamic content of a
website, this may be better solved(e.g. when scroll down, new page comes out)
